# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
The road not taken
The road diverged in a yellow wood
and sorry I could not travel both and be one traveller
Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could
to where it bent to the undergrowth
then took the other and as just as fair
and having perhaps on the better claim
because it was grassy and unwanted wear
